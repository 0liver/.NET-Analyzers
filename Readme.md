# Lombiq .NET Analyzers



## About

.NET code analyzers and code convention settings for [Lombiq](https://lombiq.com) projects. We use these to enforce common standards across all our .NET projects, including e.g. in all of our [open-source Orchard Core extensions](https://github.com/Lombiq/Open-Source-Orchard-Core-Extensions). If you contribute to our open-source projects you'll be guides by these rules too.


## Documentation
